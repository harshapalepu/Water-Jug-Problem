This code is a Prolog program that solves the classic Water Jug Problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS). In this case, you're given:

two jugs, a 4-liter one and a 3-liter one, a pump which has unlimited water which you can use to fill the jug, and the ground on which water may be poured. Neither jug has any measuring markings on it. How can you get exactly 2-liter of water in the 4-liter jug?
